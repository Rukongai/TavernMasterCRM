# TavCRM

For Tavern Master on steam

I wanted to be able to see specifically how many customers came to my restaurant and were pending orders when the Tavern closed. Unfulfilled customers that didn't storm out

Right now this addon just gives you a little popup on the screen that shows you counters for various stats as well as showing number of people served out of attended in the Summary Popup
